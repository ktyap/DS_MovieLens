# MovieLens project

This project was part of the requirement for the [PH125.9x: Data Science: Capstone](edx.org/course/data-science-capstone). In this project, a movie recommendation system is created using a subset of the MovieLens dataset.

The recommender system is be used to make specific recommendations to users based on ratings which they have given to movies. If a user is predicted to give a five stars rating to a specific movie, then that movie would be a good candidate for a recommendation to be made to the user.

The dataset in this project comprises of a subset of the database of 10 million ratings on about 10,000 movies by 72,000 users, provided by the [GroupLens research lab](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/).
